Based on the theory of cellular automata and the existing multi-dimensional cellular automata encryption algorithm, this paper proposes a three-dimensional cellular automata 3D CA(3 Dimensional Cellular Automata) encryption system to study its application in the fields of symmetric encryption, hash encryption, the research results and innovation points are as follows:
1. At present, most of the research focuses on two-dimensional cellular automata in the fields of random number generation, symmetric encryption algorithm, hash encryption, etc.. and the research in the field of three-dimensional cellular automata is far from mature. This paper attempts to construct two evolutionary rules based on two-dimensional Von Neumann neighborhood structure, and apply them in three-dimensional space, explore their applications in the fields of symmetric encryption, hash encryption according to their characteristics.
2. By analyzing the two evolutionary rules in 1, rule1 and rule2, It can be proved that the reversibility of rule1 and the zeroing of rule2, the xor homomorphism plaintext reduction characteristics of the two.
3. Applying rule1 to n-n-n three-dimensional space (n=2k, k=1,2,....),It can be proved that it is reversible under cyclic boundary conditions and has different evolutionary periods for different n. Then, a symmetric encryption scheme based on the reversible two-dimensional rule is designed, and the scheme has excellent confusion and diffusion through further displacement operations.
4. Applying rule2 to n-n-n three-dimensional space (n=2k, k=1, 2,....), it can be proved that after the first evolutionary cycle, the state in the cellular automata is all zeroed, so according to its information loss characteristics, a one-way hash algorithm can be designed, and good diffusion characteristics and anti-collision resistance can be achieved in combination with the displacement operation of the structure.
5. Cryptanalysis of the above encryption algorithm is carried out to draw conclusions. Use pseudocode to describe the algorithm of the encryption system, and use C language program to obtain experimental results.
